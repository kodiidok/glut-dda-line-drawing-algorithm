**DDA Line Drawing Visualization**

This C++ program utilizes OpenGL to visually demonstrate the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) line drawing algorithm. Users input coordinates for the starting and ending points, and the program calculates and displays the line. The visualization includes pixel plots, a Cartesian grid, and a thick green line connecting the inputted points. Users can interact with the visualization using keyboard inputs to move, scale, and rotate a green square.

### Usage:

1. **User Input:**
   - Enter coordinates for the starting and ending points when prompted.

### Features:

- Visualization of DDA line drawing algorithm.
- Dynamic display of pixels, Cartesian grid, and a thick green line.
- Interactive features for moving, scaling, and rotating a green square.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different input coordinates and interactions!

**Note:**
- Ensure OpenGL libraries are installed.
- Tested on Linux environment. Compatibility with other systems may require adjustments.
- The program may need to be recompiled based on the specific development environment.
